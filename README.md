[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


A native Android application designed to streamline the process of requesting line clearance permits via SMS.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: A basic login screen for authorized personnel.
- **Substation & Feeder Selection**: A nested list view to first select a substation, then a specific feeder from real-world data.
- **Automated SMS Generation**: Creates an SMS with a pre-filled message and recipient phone number for the line clearance request.
- **Development-Friendly**: Easily bypass the login screen for testing by modifying `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup
