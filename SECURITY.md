## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to **[CONTACT@EXAMPLE.COM]**.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1.  Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2.  Audit the code to find any potential similar problems.
3.  Prepare fixes for all supported versions.
4.  Release new versions with the fixes to the Google Play Store or directly to stakeholders.

We credit reporters for identifying security issues (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
